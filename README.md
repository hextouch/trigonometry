- Unit circle

### 2. Trigonometric Functions
- Sine, cosine, tangent
- Reciprocal functions (cosecant, secant, cotangent)
- Graphs of trig functions

### 3. Trigonometric Identities
- Pythagorean identities
- Angle sum and difference identities
- Double-angle and half-angle identities
- Product-to-sum and sum-to-product

### 4. Solving Trigonometric Equations
- Basic equations
- Equations involving identities
- Inverse trigonometric functions

### 5. Applications of Trigonometry
- Right triangle problems
- Law of sines and cosines
- Area of triangles
- Harmonic motion
